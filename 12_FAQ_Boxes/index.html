          Does the Moon really "protect" the Earth from impacts?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Let’s do some math. As a target, you need to determine the cross-section of the Moon (target Moon is a disk). The radius of the Moon is 1,737 km, so its cross-sectional area is 9.5 X 106 km2. The area of a sphere at the distance of the Moon (384,400 km) is 1.9 X 1012 km2. Therefore, if something were to pass by the Moon’s orbit on the way to the Earth, the chances of hitting the Moon would be the ratio of target Moon to the area of a sphere at the distance of the Moon: 1/200,000. Not very good protection!

          Will pictures help me better understand the phases of the Moon and its location relative to Earth?  
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Looking at pictures and doing an activity that has you as the Earth looking at the positions of the Moon and Sun really helps. The thing to remember is that the Moon is a ball being lit up by the distant Sun (always half illuminated and always in the direction of the Sun). From the Earth, as the Moon goes around, how much of the lit side of the Moon do you see? Practice, practice, practice.

          Exactly how does the Moon stabilize Earth’s obliquity—is it by gravity?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          Yes, it is gravity. Recall how a tightrope walker is stabilized by holding a long pole. In this case, gravity is pulling down on the pole and it takes more force (torque) to turn the pole (and the person with it). It is the same thing with a spinning bicycle wheel. The torque keeps the wheel upright and you from falling off the bike. In the same way, the Moon going around the Earth is like the spinning wheel—it takes more force to move the axis of the Earth because of the gravitational pull of the Moon on the Earth (torque).

          Earth has an effect on the Moon just as it affects us. What are those effects?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          We’re all familiar with the concept of ocean tides, but tides also occur in a dry rocky body. Earth raises tides on the Moon, resulting in the shape of the Moon being very slightly non-spherical, with a tidal bulge aligned in the direction of Earth and a second tidal bulge on the opposite sides of the Moon.

          Will the Moon continue to move farther away from Earth?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          The moon will continue to move farther away from Earth until the Earth’s rotation has slowed to the point where both the Moon and Earth keep the same sides facing each other at all times. But the story doesn’t end there. Earth will continue to slow down because of tides raised on Earth by the Sun. As Earth begins rotating more slowly than the Moon orbits, the influence of tides will cause the Moon to start getting closer to Earth. This is currently happening to the Martian moon Phobos. Phobos orbits Mars faster than Mars rotates and tides on Mars are causing Phobos to move slowly towards the red planet. For the Earth-Moon system, in a few billion years our Moon will be so close to Earth that Earth’s gravity pulls it apart. When that happens the debris from the Moon will form a ring system around Earth much like Saturn’s ring system. The image below is what Earth might look like in a few billion years with a ring system and continents in a totally different configuration than today because of plate tectonics.
